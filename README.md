## Introduction
Theta is a simple weather app created in React Native and utilises Expo. I am learning React Native and I decided to create an app I would actually use on an almost daily basis. So, after following a very basic tutorial for a weather app, I restructured
it to have several new quality of life features.

## Usage
Head over to [releases](https://github.com/cataclysmnik/thetaweather-mobile/releases) tab to get the latest release. Install the apk, and if Google Play protect prompts, either scan it or install without scanning.

## Features
- Minimalistic home page.
- Much more detailed weather page on the right.
- 24-hour weather forecast of current day.
- 3-day weather forecast.
- "Your location" and "Recent searches" on search panel.
